Abstract:
===
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Variety is one of the most challenging problems in Big data research. Different data providers use different data models and formats to represent their data, which causes significant impediment to data scientists, whose goal is to make sense of all relevant data regardless of the source. Hybrid.Poly is the analytical polystore data management system designed to make all data accessible to the analyst, oblivious of the source differences. In this paper, we focus on the in-depth analysis and performance evaluation of the Linear Algebra extensions added to the Hybrid.Poly language.
