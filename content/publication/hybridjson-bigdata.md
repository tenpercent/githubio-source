Abstract:
===
Hybrid.poly is an in-memory polystore data management system, able to ingest various kinds of data and run complex analytical workloads on the ingested data [Gubanov, 2017], [Podkorytov et al., 2017]. Hybrid.JSON, a part of [Gubanov, 2017] focuses on ingesting and querying JSON documents in the polystore.
