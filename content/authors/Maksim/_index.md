I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/) department at Florida State University. 
      I have earned my undergraduate degree in [Computational Mathematics](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnuma.math.msu.su%2F) from Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia in 2015. 
      Prior to starting my Ph.D. studies, I have spent a couple of experient years at Rock Flow Dynamics as a C++ Software Engineer in a team responsible for the MPI aspect of [tNavigator](https://rfdyn.com/tnavigator/), 
      a scalable distributed oil and gas reservoir simulator; my undergraduate thesis being a part of that experience. 
      During my initial Ph.D. years, I have had a fruitful collaboration with [Dr Michael Gubanov](http://mgubanov.com) on polystore databases, search and data integration, 
      resulting in a few publications; one in [ICDE](https://dblp.org/db/conf/icde/), a flagship international conference in data engineering. 
      Currently I am pursuing my research interests in deep learning applied to natural language processing working with [Dr Xiuwen Liu](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~liux/).
