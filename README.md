## Use

0. Install Hugo and Academic
1. Customize content (clone this repo and take a look at ./themes/academic/exampleSite/ folder for understanding of the site structure)
2. Execute `hugo server` to run the site on localhost and evaluate the customization
3. Assuming you are using Github Pages for hosting, the next step is to create the repository named `YOUR_HANDLE.github.io`; skip this step if the repository already exists
4. Delete the generated site by running `rm -r public`
5. Add a submodule for the generated site by running `git submodule add -b master -f git@github.com:YOUR_HANDLE/YOUR_HANDLE.github.io.git public`
6. Regenerate the site by running `hugo`
7. Publish the site by running the sequence `cd public; git add .; git commit -m "customize your commit message reflecting changes"; git push --set-upstream origin master`
